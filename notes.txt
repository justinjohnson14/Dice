game loop:
    roll dice
    choose what to keep
    roll remaining dice or score and pass turn



Need some sort of game state to for further data processing in the future
Things to record:
-Number of dice left to roll
-Current score

Can then do some statistical analysis using the above two variables to maybe create a worthy AI to play against
