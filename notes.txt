game loop:
    roll dice
    choose what to keep
    roll remaining dice or score and pass turn

Maybe take more of a state based approach rather than continous loop
Need to be able to pass the 'Gamestate' to AI and let it do its turns 



Need some sort of game state to for further data processing in the future
Things to record:
-Number of dice left to roll
-Current score

Can then do some statistical analysis using the above two variables to maybe create a worthy AI to play against

rules:
The goal of this two player game is to be the first to reach a certain number of points
Six dice are thrown and the players alternate turns. Points are gained for every one or five thrown, and for three or more of a kind of any other numbers.
Before starting the game, both players must set the target number of points to be achieved.

Score:
1 is worth 100 points
5 is worth 50 points
three of a kind is worth 100 points * the given number
three 1's is = 1000
four or more of a kind is worth double the points of three of a kind
